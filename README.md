Java with DSA

This repository contains my Java-based solutions and notes as I learn **Data Structures and Algorithms**. It is organized by topic and difficulty, with clean and well-commented code thatâ€™s easy to understand and review. Whether you're learning DSA or preparing for interviews, feel free to explore and use the code!

What's Inside:

- âœ… Core DSA Topics 
  Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashing, Heaps, Tries, and more.

- ðŸ§  Algorithms
  Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Backtracking, Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, etc.

- ðŸ“‚ Topic-Wise Folders
  Each folder contains multiple problems with Java solutions and explanations.

- ðŸ’¬ Clean & Readable Code  
  All code is beginner-friendly, modular, and includes comments to explain the logic.
